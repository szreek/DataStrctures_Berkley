SingleLetterDisplaySimple
--------------------

This file contains a simple program that displays the most recently typed letter to the screen in a graphical user interface (GUI) window. 

SingleLetterDisplay
--------------------

An enhanced version of SingleLetterDisplaySimple that also creates a color-changing box that surrounds the text. You may find this handy when figuring out how to do your cursor (hint: one way to represent a cursor is a very skinny blinking rectangle).

KeyPressPrinter
--------------------

Creates a GUI window that is not used for drawing, but instead just for collecting and printing KeyEvents. KeyEvents are a bit counterintuitive. We highly recommend that you attempt to diagnose any KeyEvent confusion using this program, as opposed to one of the clients above or your editor.

ScrollBarExample
--------------------

Provides an example of how to use scrollbars.
